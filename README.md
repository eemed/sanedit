# SanEdit

## TODO

* LSP without installation mechanism
    * Hover
    * Completion
    * Code actions
    * (Signature help) I use hover for this too
    * Cant remember anything else I use regularly
* Highlight flickering
    - => Modify existing syntax highlight to take into account the changes made
    - => No delay exeprt if we just typed a new higfhlighted item => GOOD
* Somethings wrong with multiwidth grapheme rendering.
* Keybinds to configuration file => no default
* Async saving
    - Start saving if modified while saving quit the save process => prompt this so no accidental cancellations can occur
* play around with parsing machine JIT
    - This is its own big project
    - Should try this once we can write it in this editor :)
* Welcome screen
* Help menus to F1

* Keybindings should be sensical
    * Line up down char next prev, to keyboard not arrow keys
* Save in place

## TODO
* Add log buffer directly to editor


## Future

* LSP
    * Needs installation mechanism => complex
* Snippets
